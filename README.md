# Nucleus Framework
Nucleus Framework is a PHP based framework used to accelerate API and network related testing.

### Getting started
1. Download the source code and copy it to your project directory
2. Create a new test.php file (You can change the name if you want to)
3. Include the nucleus.php file `include_once 'path/to/nucleus.php';`
4. Initialize the Nucleus framework `nucleus::init();`
5. Start writing tests! You can check the examples folder if you need help writing tests

### Why should you use the Nucleus Framework?
##### 1. Very useful for building stable and production ready services
When you run your Nucleus tests, you will not only see which API's failed testing, but you can also keep track of stuff like the response time. You can even include network based tests to show the current status of your web server

##### 2. Extremely easy to use and integrate
You can integrate this framework in any PHP based service within minutes. And it's super easy to use. You can start testing your API's with as little as 2 lines of code!

##### 3. It's completely free an open-source
You can download it, redistribute it, modify it or even contribute to the project. This gives you the power to make your services awesome!

### Restrictions
##### 1. Only supports GET requests
At the moment you can only use the Nucleus Framework to test GET requests. We are busy adding support for more request types

##### 2. No support for parameters
There is currently no support for parameters. You would need to manually format your URL strings

##### 3. No encryption support
We would like to include encryption in the Nucleus Framework. At the moment you would have to handle the encryption manually

### Support the project
The best way to support the project is to contribute to the source code. If you are not a developer or don't have the time to contribute, you can always help the project by helping us spread the word:
